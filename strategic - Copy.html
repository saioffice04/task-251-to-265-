            <p class="a"> b.&nbsp;&nbsp;the existing resources do not enable this relaxation, so as to include the
                ideal solution in the restriction area, it is necessary to find a compromise
                solution close to the ideal solution, respecting the original restriction area.
                The formulation used in this case is called “global criterion” or the
                weighting method used by Kinoshita (1996).</p>

        <p class="a">The difficulties in solving nonlinear problems occur even when the number of
            variables is small. If the goal function is not linear, there may be the case of
            optimization with several maximum and minimum points. In the case that one of
            restriction equations (or all of them) is nonlinear, the area of feasible solutions
            may be formed by nonconvex regions, and then optimization problem requires
            heuristic algorithms. Usually, the optimization problem of great interest to
            corporations is the optimization of nonlinear problems with multiple goals</p>
            <p class="a">The best known methods for multiple criteria optimization problems are:</p>
            <ul class="a">
                <li>“Global criterion” method (Kinoshita ,1996),</li>
                <li>“De Novo” programming (Tabucanon ,1988), and</li>
                <li>Goal programming (Hillier & Liberman, 1980).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="a">The first method builds a new goal function by weighting multiple goals functions
                and preserving the area formed by the restrictions equations. The second
                method relaxes (altering the restrictions equations) the restriction area so as to
                hold an optimum solution called “ideal solution.” Goal programming tries to
                reach a compromise establishing qualitative goals to address the demands of
                the optimization problems</p>
